#PhotoMasterclass

A tiny app from scratch where users can pick a lesson from a list and watch it in the details view. 

Also they have to be able to download and watch the lesson when there's no internet connection.

### 📱 **Views**

- Show title “Lessons”
- Implement the lesson list screen using SwiftUI

- Show video player
- Show a “Download” button to start download for offline viewing
- Show a “Cancel download” and progress bar when video is downloading
- Show lesson title
- Show lesson description
- Show a “Next lesson” button to play next lesson from the list
